# Welcome 👋

Hi, I'm <b>Shaurya</b>. I have interests in <b>Machine Learning, specifically Reinforcement Learning, NLP, and Recommender Systems</b>. Moreover, I play Table Tennis 🏓 and listen to Piano 🎹 and other musical instruments.

## Highlights
👨‍🎓 Currently I'm a MS student in Business Analytics (Deep Learning Specialisation) at The University of Texas at Dallas. Completed **B. Tech.** in **Information Technology** from **Delhi Technological University**

🥇 Recently **Won** the **HPE Data Science Hackathon** at the 7th Annual Business Analytics Symposium, presenting an Optimal Marketing Budget Allocation System through the application of Gradient Boosted models, Bayesian Statistics, and **Genetic ALgorithms** {[LINK](https://jindal.utdallas.edu/news/jindal-school-takes-first-place-in-two-recent-competitions/#content2)}

🤖 Researching and learning **Reinforcement Learning** systems with application in **Recommendation Systems**. Developed a Music Recommender System using Deep Q-Learning and Actor-Critic model, acheiving a diverse selection of music (9.3% vs 7.6%) and better identification of songs skipped by users (49% vs 54%) {[LINK](https://github.com/shauryat1298/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Music-Recommendation)}

📢 Developed a transparent and interpretable **Click Through Rate (CTR) prediction system** able to identify high importance features running on lower computational requirements using **Transformers** with Multi-head Self-Attention and Hierarchical Attention layers [LINK](https://github.com/shauryat1298/CTR-Prediction-using-Attention-Transformers)

📊 Worked as Data Scientist (Sep 21 - Jul 22) at **Fuzone e-Systems**. I worked on building ANN, RNN, LSTM, bi-directional LSTM and Gradient Boosted models to optimize future digital ad campaigns

🌧 Interned as Data Science Intern in **National Council of Applied Economic Research**. Developed DNN and Time Series Forecasting models for weather records, handling big data on HDFS technologies
