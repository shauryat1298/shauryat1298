# Welcome 👋

Hi, I'm <b>Shaurya</b>. I have interests in <b>Machine Learning, specifically Reinforcement Learning, NLP, and Recommender Systems</b>. Moreover, I play Table Tennis 🏓 and listen to Piano 🎹 and other musical instruments.

## Highlights
- Currently I'm a MS student in Business Analytics (Deep Learning Specialisation) at The University of Texas at Dallas. Completed **B. Tech.** in **Information Technology** from **Delhi Technological University**
- Recently won the HPE Data Science Hackathon at the 7th Annual Business Analytics Symposium, presenting an Optimal Marketing Budget Allocation System through the application of Gradient Boosted models, Bayesian Statistics, and Genetic ALgorithms [LINK](https://jindal.utdallas.edu/news/jindal-school-takes-first-place-in-two-recent-competitions/#content2)
- Currently learning and researching **Reinforcement Learning** systems with application in Recommendation Systems. Developed a Music Recommender System using Deep Q-Learning and Actor-Critic model, acheiving a diverse selection of music (9.3% vs 7.6%) and better identification of songs skipped by users (49% vs 54%) [LINK](https://github.com/shauryat1298/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Music-Recommendation)
- Developed a transparent and interpretable Click Through Rate (CTR) prediction system able to identify high importance features running on lower computational requirements using Transformers with Multi-head Self-Attention and Hierarchical Attention layers [LINK](https://github.com/shauryat1298/CTR-Prediction-using-Attention-Transformers)
- Worked as Data Scientist (Sep 21 - Jul 22) at **Fuzone e-Systems**. I worked on building ANN, RNN, LSTM, bi-directional LSTM and Gradient Boosted models to optimize future digital ad campaigns
- Interned as Data Science Intern in **National Council of Applied Economic Research**. Developed DNN and Time Series Forecasting models for weather records, handling big data on HDFS technologies
